# Leetcode-91-Medium-DP
Solution is from SimplyPocky.    The problem is quite hard compared to other medium problems. Maybe it's because I didn't do dp for a long time, I didn't figure this out on my own this time. I tried recursion at first, but there are too many conditions to take into account, which makes it wrong.

One thing to notice is that, in the solution, we first consider the condition that is always true, which is using the first digit as a character. Then, we check for the second condition. It is a little bit different from other problems that I did.
